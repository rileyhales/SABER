In the "Regions" folder, the "africa.py" script is the only script that contains comments, but these comments are relevant for every script in that folder. 

The "FINAL-combine.py" script should be run after every script in the "Regions" folder has been run.
The scripts in the "Regions" folder will format the data in preparation for the "FINAL-combine.py" script.
The "FINAL-combine.py" script combines and exports all the data from each region into one large global dataset.
