# SABER

In the "Regions" folder, the "africa.py" file is the only file that contains comments, but these comments are relevant for every script in that folder. 

The "FINAL-combine.py" file should be run after each region's data has been combined and formatted by its respective region's python script.
This file combines and exports all the data from each region into one large global dataset.
